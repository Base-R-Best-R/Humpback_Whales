# Speed and Breath

During the presentation a comment came up, that speed and breathing frequency have a dependent relationship, which would potentially influence the estimates in our mixed effects model.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 5}

# ignore grouping 
ggplot(dat_whale, aes(x = logspeed, y = logatem)) +
   geom_point(size = 2) +
   geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
   theme_bw() -> plot1

# different groups 
ggplot(dat_whale, aes(x = logspeed, y = logatem, color = treatment)) +
   geom_point(size = 2) +
   geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
   theme_bw() -> plot2

plot1 + plot2
```
